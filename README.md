# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

My program creates an html page that holds data created using inquirer prompts. The prompts dynamically load depending on the answers the user picks resulting in the user being able to pick as many Engineers or Interns they want after setting up the manager profile.

## Installation

Once the program is pulled into a VS code editor then in the terminal enter npm i so the respective npm files will load into your team generator file.

## Usage

Type node index.js into the terminal and answer the prompts. When the question to add more members you won't be allowed to enter more than one manager. Once you have added enough members select no for the last question and the html page will render to the output directive folder.
